                <h1 class="title">Can Apps Stop Singapore's Taxi Shortage?</h1>
                <p>A story by Yikchun Lam</p>
                <p>
                    As reliable as Singapore's public transport system is, as many as 596,000 cab or ride-hailing trips were made in Singapore every day in April of 2022, in addition to the 930,979 commuters that ride the city's rail and bus lines every day. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before ride-hailing giants Grab (and previously, Uber) became a common sight on the city state's roads, taxi companies like Comfort and CityCab were the major players in Singapore's point-to-point transport economy.. However, since hitting a peak in 2015, the total number of vehicles in taxi fleets has decreased by almost half, in contrast to a dramatic rise in the number of private-hire vehicles, which includes car rentals and cars-for-hire services like Grab and Gojek (an Indonesian competitor)

                    In today's consumer landscape, one might argue that the ease of phone apps could be the defining factor as to why non-digital industries are suffering. Apps are often painted as the solution  - get on the app,  or get left behind. The platform fees are the price you pay in order to stay competitive. However, that logic doesn't seem to be working for taxi companies in Singapore.

                <p>It's clear that the issues causing the taxi shortage in Singapore run deeper than just being tech-savvy. From the issue of ageing driver pools (an estimate 48.1% of the public transport labour force in Singapore is over 55), to rising diesel prices and vehicle rentals, there might not be one clear solution to the taxi problem. And for a nation that is trying to rein in the growth of private vehicle ownership, a taxi shortage certainly isn't going to help.<br><br>

                As more workers return to the office and tourism picks up again, will the taxi industry's decline be halted, or will the sun set on it, like in New York and Philadelphia? <br><br>Only time will tell.</p>
